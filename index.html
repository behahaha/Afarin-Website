			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Afarin Abasi, an 19 year old developer and student currently residing in the greatest city in the world, Toronto. Born with a competitive spirit and a natural desire to excel, I put very high expectations on my work and myself. I'm currently studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics at the University of Toronto. </p>
			<p>Why CS? Well, I'm a problem solver at heart and puzzles have always been my strong suit. But even more than that, the idea of building something from scratch, from the ground up, <em>really</em> excites me. </p>
			<p>As well, I excel in self-management. My strict discipline and laser focus give me the confidence to execute difficult tasks and solve problems in an autonomous manner. As a self taught web developer, I've formed an eye for detail and a passion for clean design and effective code. </p>
			<p>If I'm not coding, you'll find me listening to Coldplay, reading Bloomberg Businessweek or horseback riding, which is pretty cool.</p>
